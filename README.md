# Trust-Aware-Recommender-System
Implemented the dynamic mechanism to construct trust network of the users that leads to improve the reliability and accuracy of predictions.

Two datasets are used
1. Rating dataset: Ratings provided by users on movies.
2. Trust dataset: Depicting trust between user exists or not.

Results better than collaborative filtering algorithm since it consider trust factor between users so that it can also predict initial
rating on movies for cold start users. Data sparcity problem in collaborative filtering can also be eliminated.
